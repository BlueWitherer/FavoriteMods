## About
The *Favorite Mods* mod focuses on creating a dedicated interface with a list of mods the player deems their favorites. This allows the player to save time when looking for specific mods they enjoy or need the most.

### Favorites
A button with a star icon will appear on the left-hand side of the Geode mods page that creates a pop-up of the mods you have in your favorites.

To add favorites, simply look for the mod by scrolling or typing its name or ID in the search box, press the star icon to the right, and then you have a favorite mod! You can also press the star again to un-favorite the mod.

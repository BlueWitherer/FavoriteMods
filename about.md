## About
This mod focuses on creating a dedicated UI with a list of installed mods, which prioritizes the mods you chose to be your favorites! Save time when looking for mods you enjoy or need the most.

---

### Favorites
A <cg>button</c> will appear on the left-hand side of the Geode mods page that creates a pop-up listing all installed mods, prioritizing the mods you have included in your favorites.

To <cy>add a mod to your favorites</c>, simply look for it by scrolling or <cy>typing its name, description, or ID</c> in the search box. Then, <cl>press the star icon</c> to the right, and it should add it as a favorite mod! You can also <cl>press the star again</c> to <cy>un-favorite the mod</c>. Favorite mods will always be listed at the top-most part in the first-most page of the list.

You can also quickly add favorites through Geode's mod pop-ups! Just look for the <cg>favorite button at the bottom left of the pop-up</c> and <cl>press it</c>! <cr>You will be required to already have the mod installed to see this button.</c>
